The Python homeworks were really easy, so they probably only took around 30 minutes.",

He talks about so many things outside of his slides and tends to go on tangents for things he finds interesting, so you'd definitely be missing a lot if you didn't go to lectures.

Quizzes and midterms had the same format - a constants sheet would be given and a calculator allowed. This meant generally memorizing as many equations and derivations as possible - these weren't too difficult, as they were generally just things like deriving circular velocity. The group project involved presenting on a next/current-gen facility. I didn't think any of these assignments were very worthwhile.",

He didn't put in grades until dead week so you might not know how you're doing, but everyone in my class got an A. He understands that graduate students (and even us undergrads) are busy and can have more important things to do, so he tends to grade pretty leniently. He also accepts really late projects - I turned in like 3/5 during dead week.",

If you aren't comfortable programming, I can't really recommend this class. They each cover a separate topic in planetary astrophysics - you can check out my GitHub (justin-kang) if you actually want to see what they ended up as. Because I was drowned with work early on, I spent literally all of my thanksgiving break and on working on these projects. Kraus is readily available at office hours though - I think I went to his office literally every day after class for help. Besides these you have an HST-style proposal where you write a full blown astronomical proposal (linked to your 5th, final independent project) and a take-home/oral exam (your choice, only 10% of final grade). We also had two paper presentations, where we had to lead a discussion on two recent papers of our choice.",

The lectures are very similar to the undergrad version, but it does go a lot more into the math/physics, as well as actual data analysis used in the field. If you're interested in planets, I'd definitely recommend taking both undergrad and grad versions. If you know programming and have free time, I'd recommend just taking the graduate version.",

I often had to read through literature to understand how to approach the homework, or find obscure astronomy programs that would do what I needed. Comparable to Adam's graduate class or OS imo. Homeworks are a mixture of derivations (pure math) and programming, so I hope you know Python or something really well. A lot of the projects involve real data (e.g. FITS files), so this course gives good experience for both theory and observation.",

The class project involved using MESA to simulate stars, although he's open for suggestions if you have other ideas.

Many DSers ended the class only having to pass the final to get the grade they wanted. In addition, sometimes there will be bonus questions to further boost your grade. Concept wise, its an intro course, so don't expect much in depth material. Rather you will find yourself memorizing a wide breadth of material drawing from genetics and OChem 2.

At the beginning of the course Anslyn gives you a lot of input about how you want the course to be scored (t-scores or Anslyn assigning cutoffs himself, plus minus grading or not, etc.). Overall if you put in some amount of effort it's not too difficult to get an A (two As and a B on the midterms/final will get you an A, and the final grade is pretty much based on the letter grades on the exams; each exam gets different A cutoffs etc. assigned and the cutoffs are usually quite generous)",
        "workload": "Regular homework assignments that are only checked for completion, and they only count for your grade if you're on the borderline between two grades; if you are close to a cutoff (like two As and a C on the two best midterms and final) they'll check if you completed most of your homeworks throughout the semester and if you have you'll get bumped up. The homework is really not a big deal at all because of this. Three midterms with one drop (best 2 of 3 are worth 60% of the grade) and a comprehensive final (40%); depending on whether you chose to t-score or not, he will tell you that the numerical grades on these don't really matter and the assigned letter grade is what counts (3 As or 2 As and a B will get you an A, 2 As and a C or an A and 2 Bs is borderline). If you're not happy with your grade he's very willing to negotiate with you so don't stress about it",

However, it's not super necessary to go to them to learn the material; I didn't go to class for half the semester and got very high As on two midterms and was able to skip the third one (since there was a drop).

You spend the first half of the semester talking about life and learning about Lin's philosophy, while getting assignments that weren't covered in class.

I think Hovav might've dumbed his second one down after seeing the results on the first. For all non-exams, you're allowed a partner to work with, which definitely helps a lot (so take this course with a friend! Mine definitely carried me :) ) The written homeworks are basically theory, asking things like evaluating different security models or asking us to explain vulnerabilities. I think that these were more approachable than some of the other psets I've gotten from CS courses. Finally the bulk - the programming assignments cover a variety of topics, from breaking C's stack to cracking user passwords. The coding assignments take roughly 10-20 hours of work to do, so about average (or maybe a bit light) for a CS course. That being said, the programming projects are probably the most difficult in terms of debugging and conceptualizing - for example, my partner and I spent about 10 hours on one of the assignments, and ended up with around 10 lines of code total for it.

He had a habit of going to around the 1:25 mark (in a 1:30 class), but I think those minutes were pretty well used.

The grad students do ask some good questions, so I found it helpful to go and jot down any clarifications from these.

You may feel that it is expected for an honors physics major to take a graduate class.\n\nYou do not have to do this.\n\nThere's a reason that graduate classes are reserved for graduate students, and it's because the prerequisite is an entire undergraduate education in physics - not only the material in the official curriculum, but the miscellaeous things that you pick up along the way. In retrospect, I would have learned more if I had taken the undergraduate relativity class. You cannot construct a building, or an understanding of general relativity, without the foundation.\n\n(Let me clarify that my experience in this class was not the fault of the professor! He taught the class at a graduate level, as he should have. Perhaps his only mistake was approving me to take the class, but, like the Biblical Tower of Babel, I did need to get my ego knocked down a notch.)\n\nYou may be afraid that if all* your peers are taking graduate courses and you are not, you won't get accepted to grad school. Honestly, taking a grad course made me question whether I even wanted to go to grad school, if the experience was going to be this taxing. (Afterward, I found out that this is considered one of the most difficult, high-workload graduate courses at UT. Truly, nobody had warned me!)\n\n*(It may feel like all your peers are overachieving to a greater extent than you, but don't forget to compare yourself to the physics majors who aren't even in honors! A fallacy I often commit, and maybe you do too, is thinking of my \"peer group\" of everyone who is on my level or more academically successful than I am, so of course I percieve myself to be at the bottom of the pack!)\n\nThe physical and mental health ramifications of my Spring 2018 experience (not caused solely by taking this graduate course, but it certainly didn't help) have a far greater impact on my life than the impact of what I learned in this course. You might think it won't happen to you; you're smarter than me; you'll work harder than me. It might not occur in the semester you take this course, but at some point, you will burn out, and then you will understand the debilitating ennui and fatigue I am trying to describe.\n\nIn April, I stopped doing the homeworks, because I opened up the textbook and was overcome by sobs as I realized I was clueless.\n\nKeep your head down and ignore the physics DSers around you who are bragging about how smart they are and how perfect their life is. (This is the WORST thing about DS, tbh) For your own good, take the undergrad section instead.\n\nThere's no funding for relativity theory research anyway."

While it did get confusing there, he made sure to tie it back to the physics and we were never assessed on purely just the math which made it easier. He always motivated what we were doing and making sure that we knew the history and applications of what we learned.

After we went online, he didn't have office hours anymore because our class time was a discussion section, but he started dedicating one section per week to hw when he realized that people needed it.

Try to make friends with graduate students - they'll be important resources in coming up with answers to some of the problems, particularly when the problems invoke some topics you may not be as familiar with (Gaussian optics, for instance). For the final presentation we had to pick a topic related to nonlinear optics and prepare a 15-minute presentation for the class.

Calculations to show that your design would actually be a working laser were essential. We had about a month for the project, which culminated in a presentation to the class and a 3-5 page design report. I think this is the part of the class Todd cares most about - he's very engaged in the presentations and wants to learn something new and interesting if at all possible. The final consisted of 11 problems worth either 10 or 20 points each. There was no way to do all of them in 3 hours. Instead, we were told to choose our favorites and give them our best shot, using all resources up to and including the Internet and Mathematica as long as we didn't talk to other people.

If you haven't, but have taken a few other upper-division math classes, it should be fine. You should enter the class with non-zero programming skill, but you really, really, really don't need much:  if you can do 10-15ish Project Euler problems, you'll be fine. If you have no programming experience, don't let it intimidate you. The course covers:  basic cryptography definitions (semantic security), classic public key cryptography (RSA, el-Gamal, Diffie-Hellman key exchange), relevant algorithms (discrete log, factoring, fast exponentiation), and the relevant number theory (modular arithmetic, Fermat's theorem and variants, introduction to elliptic curves). Blumberg's explicitly stated grading system is:  \"Pretty much everyone will get an A, B, or F. An A is if you did well, a B is if you tried but didn't do well, and an F is if you didn't try.\"",

Easier than most other upper-division math classes I've taken. If you look at Blumberg's website, he might still have up the problem sets from the previous semester. There are also short in-class quizzes that are just a way to give points for attendance and emphasize important concepts. There are midterms and a final paper--they're not particularly difficult. He gives substantial forewarning and advice for both. If you prepare for the midterms, you should do well. If you don't procrastinate too much on the final paper, you should do well.",

After that, he posts them one at a time. Also, some of the programming assignments build on each other, so if you skip or half-ass one of them, it might come back to bite you. In particular, don't half-ass your discrete log solvers. Blumberg is a super cool guy, and I enjoyed going to his office hours.",

Otherwise, it is a pretty tough course having only done Calc BC in my education prior to this point. The concepts are not the worst, but the workload can be terrible sometimes.

It's such an amazing way to get the material across to the students. \nHellmer does talk at a moderate pace so get a plugin to speed up videos.",
